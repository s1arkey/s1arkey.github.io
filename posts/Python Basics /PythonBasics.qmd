## Variables Are Names, Not Places

*A value is datum (literal) such as a number or text

*There are different types of values:

*352.3 is known as a float or double;

*22 is an integer;

*"Hello World!" is a string.

```{python}
list_example =  [10, 1.23, "like this", True, None]
print(list_example)
type(list_example)
```

\[10, 1.23, 'like this', True, None\]

*The most.
basic built-in data types that we'll need to know about are: integers, 10 floats, 1.23 strings, "like this" booleans, True nothing, None

*Python also has a built-in type of data container called a list (ex. \[10,15,20\]) that can contain anything, even different types

##Values, Variables, and Types

```{python}
a = 10
print(a)
```

*A variable is a name that refers to a value.

**We can think of a variable as a box that has a value, or multiple values, packed inside it A variable is just a name!

*Sometimes you will hear variables referred to as objects.

*Everything that is not a literal value, such as 10, is an object

##Assignment (=)

```{python}
# Here we assign the integer value 5 to the variable x.
x = 5   

# Now we can use the variable x in the next line.
y = x + 12  
y
```

*In Python, we use = to assign a value to a variable 

*In math, = means equality of both sides 

*In programs, = means assignment: assign the value on the right side to the variable on the left side.

*In programming code, everything on the right side needs to have a value.

*The right side can be a literal value, or a variable that has already been assigned a value, or a combination.

*When Python reads y= x + 12, it does the following: Sees the = in the middle.Knows that this is an assignment.

*Calculates the right side (gets the value of the object referred to by x and adds it to 12).

*Assigns the result to the left-side variable, y.

##Code and Comment Style

*The two main principles for coding and managing data are:
**Make things easier for your future self.
**Don't trust your future self.

*The # mark is Google Colab's comment character 
**The # character has many names: hash, sharp, pound, or octothorpe.
**The \# indicates that the rest of the line is to be ignored.
**Write comments before the line that you want the comment to apply to.

*Consider adding more comments on code cells and their results using text cells.

##Brackets 
*There are several kinds of brackets in Python, including \[\], {}, and ().

```{python}
vector = ['a', 'b']
vector[0]
```

*[] is used to denote a list or to signify accessing a position using an index


```{python}
{'a', 'b'}  # set
{'first_letter': 'a', 'second_letter': 'b'}  # dictionary
```
{'first_letter': 'a', 'second_letter': 'b'}
{} is used to denote a set or a dictionary (with key-value pairs)


*() is used to denote
**a tuple, or
**the arguments to a function, ex. function(x) where x is the input passed to the function
##Q1
```{python}
(2**5/(7*(4-2**3)))
```
##Q2
```{python}
20 == '20'
```
*This is saying 20 is not equal to ‘20’ because they are different data types (int vs string)
```{python}
x = 4.0
y = .5
z = 3*y - x

x < y or 3*y < x
```
True
  *This says the expression is true since 3*.5 < 4
  
##Q3
```{python}
fare = "$10.00"
tip = "2.00$"
tax = "$ 0.80"
```
Write a Python code that uses slicing and the print() function to print out the following message:

The total trip cost is: $12.80

```{python}
total =fare = "$10.00"
tip = "2.00$"
tax = "$ 0.80"
total = fare[0:2] + tip[0] + tax[3:6]
print("The total trip cost is:", total)

#The total trip cost is: $12.80The total trip cost is:", total)
```
##Q4
```{python}
list_variable = [100, 144, 169, 1000, 8]
```
Write a Python code that uses print() and max() functions to print out the largest value in the list, list_variable, as follows:

The largest value in the list is: 1000
```{python}
list_variable = [100,144,169,1000,8]
x =max(list_variable)
print('The largest value in the list is:',x)

#The largest value in the list is: 1000
```
The largest value in the list is: 1000
##Q5
*Import the pandas library as pd.
*Install the itables package.
*From itables, import the function init_notebook_mode and show.
```{python}
import pandas as pd
!pip install itables
from itables import init_notebook_mode
from itables import show
```
