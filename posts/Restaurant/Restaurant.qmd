##Question 1

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
```

Load the data.frame for Question 1.

```{r}
restaurant <- read.csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/DOHMH_NYC_Restaurant_Inspection.csv')
```

## Q1a

What are the mean, standard deviation, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum of SCORE for each GRADE of restaurants?

```{r}
restaurant %>% 
  group_by(GRADE) %>% 
  skim(SCORE) %>% 
  select(-n_missing)
```

## Q1b

How many restaurants with a GRADE of A are there in NYC?
How much percentage of restaurants in NYC are a GRADE of C?

```{r}
freq <- as.data.frame( table(restaurant$GRADE) )

prop <- as.data.frame( 100 * prop.table(table(restaurant$GRADE)) )
```

## Q1c

Provide both (1) ggplot code and (2) a simple comment to describe how the distribution of SCORE varies by GRADE and CRITICAL FLAG.

- Boxplots

```{r}
ggplot(restaurant) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = SCORE, y = GRADE, fill = GRADE) ) +
  facet_grid( CRITICAL.FLAG ~ . )
```

-Histograms

```{r}
ggplot(restaurant) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = SCORE), binwidth = 1 ) +
  facet_grid( CRITICAL.FLAG ~ GRADE )
```
-Mostly,
  -The values of SCORE for GRADE A ranges from 0 to 13.
  -The values of SCORE for GRADE B ranges 13 to 27.
  -The values of SCORE for GRADE C ranges 24 to 75.
-For Not Critical type, two SCORE values around 1 and 12 are most common, while 12 is the single most common SCORE value for Critical type.

## Q1d

Provide both (1) ggplot code and (2) a simple comment to describe how the proportion of CRITICAL FLAG varies by GRADE and BORO.

```{r}
ggplot(restaurant) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = CRITICAL.FLAG,
               y = after_stat(prop), group = 1)) +
  facet_grid( GRADE ~ BORO )
```

-For GRADE A, the probability distribution of CRITICAL FLAG are similar across BOROs.

-For GRADE B, the restaurants in Staten Island are more likely to be Critical than in other BOROs.

-For GRADE C, the restaurants in Bronx are more likely to be Critical than in other BOROs.

## Q1e

For the 10 most common CUISINE DESCRIPTION values, find the CUISINE DESCRIPTION value that has the highest proportion of GRADE A.

```{r}
q2e <- restaurant %>% 
  group_by(CUISINE.DESCRIPTION) %>% 
  mutate(n = n()) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  filter(dense_rank(-n) <= 10) %>% 
  group_by(CUISINE.DESCRIPTION, GRADE) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  group_by(CUISINE.DESCRIPTION) %>% 
  mutate(prop_A = n / sum(n)) %>% 
  filter(GRADE == 'A') %>% 
  arrange(-prop_A)
```

## Q1f

-Find the 3 most common names of restaurants (DBA) in each BORO.
  -If the third most common DBA values are multiple, please include all the DBA values.
-Overall, which DBA value is most common in NYC?

```{r}
q2f <- restaurant %>% 
  select(DBA, BORO) %>% 
  group_by(BORO, DBA) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  mutate(ranking = dense_rank(-n)) %>% 
  filter(ranking <= 3) %>% 
  arrange(BORO, ranking)

q2f_ <- restaurant %>% 
  group_by(DBA) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  arrange(-n)
```

Note that chipotle mexican grill and subway are both the third most popular franchise/chain in Manhattan. üåØ

Overall, dunkin is the most popular franchise/chain in NYC. üç©

## Q1g

For all the DBA values that appear in the result of Q1f, find the DBA value that is most likely to commit critical violation.

```{r}
q2g <- restaurant %>% 
  filter(DBA %in% q2f$DBA) %>% 
  group_by(DBA, CRITICAL.FLAG) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  group_by(DBA) %>% 
  mutate(lag_n = lag(n),
         tot = sum(n),
         prop_crit = lag_n / tot) %>% 
  select(DBA, prop_crit) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(prop_crit)) %>% 
  arrange(-prop_crit)
```

-Among popular franchises/chains, subway is most likely to commit Critical violation in NYC. ü•™
