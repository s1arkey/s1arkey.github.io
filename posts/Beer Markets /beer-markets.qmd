## Question 1 üç∫

For Question 1, run the following R command to read the beer market data.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
```

```{r}
beer_mkts <- read.csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/beer_markets.csv')
```

```{r}
rmarkdown::paged_table(beer_mkts)
```

-Each observation in beer_mkts is a household-level transaction record for a purchase of beer.

## Q1a

-Find the top 5 markets in terms of the total beer_floz.
-Find the top 5 markets in terms of the total beer_floz of BUD LIGHT.
-Find the top 5 markets in terms of the total beer_floz of BUSCH LIGHT.
-Find the top 5 markets in terms of the total beer_floz of COORS LIGHT.
-Find the top 5 markets in terms of the total beer_floz of MILLER LITE.
-Find the top 5 markets in terms of the total beer_floz of NATURAL LIGHT.

```{r}
Q1a1 <- beer_mkts %>% 
   group_by(market) %>% 
   summarize(beer_floz_tot = sum(beer_floz, na.rm = T)) %>% 
   arrange(-beer_floz_tot) %>% 
   slice(1:5)

Q1a_bud <- beer_mkts %>% 
  filter(brand == "BUD LIGHT") %>% 
  group_by(market) %>% 
  summarize(beer_floz_tot = sum(beer_floz, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  arrange(-beer_floz_tot) %>% 
  slice(1:5)

Q1a_busch <- beer_mkts %>% 
  filter(brand == "BUSCH LIGHT") %>% 
  group_by(market) %>% 
  summarize(beer_floz_tot = sum(beer_floz, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  arrange(-beer_floz_tot) %>% 
  slice(1:5)

Q1a_coors <- beer_mkts %>% 
  filter(brand == "COORS LIGHT") %>% 
  group_by(market) %>% 
  summarize(beer_floz_tot = sum(beer_floz, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  arrange(-beer_floz_tot) %>% 
  slice(1:5)

Q1a_miller <- beer_mkts %>% 
  filter(brand == "MILLER LITE") %>% 
  group_by(market) %>% 
  summarize(beer_floz_tot = sum(beer_floz, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  arrange(-beer_floz_tot) %>% 
  slice(1:5)

Q1a_natural <- beer_mkts %>% 
  filter(brand == "NATURAL LIGHT") %>% 
  group_by(market) %>% 
  summarize(beer_floz_tot = sum(beer_floz, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  arrange(-beer_floz_tot) %>% 
  slice(1:5)
```

## Q1büçª

-For households that purchased BUD LIGHT at least once, what fraction of households did purchase only BUD LIGHT?

-For households that purchased BUSCH LIGHT at least once, what fraction of households did purchase only BUSCH LIGHT?

-For households that purchased COORS LIGHT at least once, what fraction of households did purchase only COORS LIGHT?

-For households that purchased MILLER LITE at least once, what fraction of households did purchase only MILLER LITE?

-For households that purchased NATURAL LIGHT at least once, what fraction of households did purchase only NATURAL LIGHT?

-Which beer brand does have the largest proportion of such loyal consumers?

```{r}
q1b <- beer_mkts %>% 
  mutate(bud = ifelse(brand=="BUD LIGHT", 1, 0), # 1 if brand=="BUD LIGHT"; 0 otherwise
         busch = ifelse(brand=="BUSCH LIGHT", 1, 0),
         coors = ifelse(brand=="COORS LIGHT", 1, 0),
         miller = ifelse(brand=="MILLER LITE", 1, 0),
         natural = ifelse(brand=="NATURAL LIGHT", 1, 0),
         .after = hh) %>% 
  select(hh:natural) %>%  # select the variables we need
  group_by(hh) %>% 
  summarise(n_transactions = n(), # number of beer transactions for each hh
            n_bud = sum(bud), # number of BUD LIGHT transactions for each hh
            n_busch = sum(busch), 
            n_coors = sum(coors), 
            n_miller = sum(miller), 
            n_natural = sum(natural) 
  ) %>% 
  summarise(loyal_bud = sum(n_transactions == n_bud) / sum(n_bud > 0), 
              # sum(n_transactions == n_bud) : the number of households that purchased BUD LIGHT only
              # sum(n_bud > 0) : the number of households that purchased BUD LIGHT at least once.
            loyal_busch = sum(n_transactions == n_busch) / sum(n_busch > 0),
            loyal_coors = sum(n_transactions == n_coors) / sum(n_coors > 0),
            loyal_miller = sum(n_transactions == n_miller) / sum(n_miller > 0),
            loyal_natural = sum(n_transactions == n_natural) / sum(n_natural > 0)
  )

```

## Q1c üçª

-For each household, calculate the number of beer transactions.
-For each household, calculate the proportion of each beer brand choice.

```{r}
q1c <- beer_mkts %>% 
  count(hh, brand) %>% 
  group_by(hh) %>% 
  mutate(n_tot = sum(n)) %>%  
  arrange(hh, brand) %>% 
  mutate( prop = n / n_tot )
