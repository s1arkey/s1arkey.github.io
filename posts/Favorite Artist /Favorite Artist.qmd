## Favorite Artist

The purpose of this blog is to give reader's insight into my favorite artist's within the Spotify DataFrame

Below is the spotify DataFrame that reads the file spotify_all.csv containing data of Spotify users' playlist information (Source: Spotify Million Playlist Dataset Challenge)..

```{python}
import pandas as pd
spotify = pd.read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/spotify_all.csv')
spotify
```

# Variable Description

-   pid: playlist ID; unique ID for playlist
-   playlist_name: a name of playlist
-   pos: a position of the track within a playlist (starting from 0)
-   artist_name: name of the track's primary artist
-   track_name: name of the track
-   duration_ms: duration of the track in milliseconds
-   album_name: name of the track's album \## Occurances

```{python}
artist_count = spotify['artist_name'].value_counts()
artist_count
```

-   The above code counts the occurences of each artist as you can see, Kanye West appears the most in playlists and he is my favorite artist.

## Favorite Artist Data Frame

```{python}
favorite_artists = spotify[spotify['artist_name'].isin(['Kanye West', '21 Savage','Drake'])]
favorite_artists
```

-   The above code filters the DataFrame to show only the songs by my three favorite artists: Drake, Kanye West, and 21 Savage

## Favorite Artists Occurances

```{python}
favorite_count = favorite_artists['artist_name'].value_counts()
favorite_count
```

-   This code shows the number of occurrences that my three favorite artists have in the data set

## Favorite Artist's Track Duration

```{python}
sorted_fav_artists = favorite_artists.sort_values(by = 'duration_ms', ascending = False)
no_duplicates = sorted_fav_artists.drop_duplicates(subset=['artist_name', 'track_name'])
longest_tracks = no_duplicates[['artist_name', 'track_name', 'duration_ms']].head(10)
longest_tracks
```

-   The above code sorts the DateFrame containing only tracks from my favorite artists by the length of their songs
-   It then gets rid of any duplicates so I only see one of each song
-   Then I see the top 10 longest tracks by my three favorite artists
-   Kanye Takes the three longest songs out of my favorite artists.

## Favorite Artist's Average Position

```{python}
fav_artist_name = favorite_artists['artist_name'].unique()
artist_tracks = spotify[spotify['artist_name'].isin(fav_artist_name)]
avg_pos = artist_tracks.groupby('artist_name')['pos'].mean()
avg_pos
```

-   The above code gathers the average position of tracks within a playlist for each of my three favorite artists within the Spotify DataFrame
